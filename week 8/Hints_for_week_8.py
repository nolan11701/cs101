Q4: Polynomial evaluation I
	I just used recursion to sum up the numbers in the parentheses, then used a for loop

Q5:
	here is the top half of the pyramid.
	steps = steps - 1
	for i in range(steps):
        print((steps - i) * ' ' + (1 + 2 * i) * '*')
	you can definitely figure out the rest.
